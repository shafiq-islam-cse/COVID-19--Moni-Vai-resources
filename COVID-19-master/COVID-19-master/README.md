Adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccination: machine learningand statistical approach to identify and classify incidences ofmorbidity and post-vaccination reactogenicity

Vaccination is a key public health measure to prevent infectious disease spread. Good vaccine safety and reliability are essential, especially given a
large number of recipients and the needed for widespread acceptance, so even a very small number of adverse outcomes is of concern. We thus need methods
to predict the risk of adverse outcomes and so avoid or mitigate them.

In this study, we finds the key reasons of adverse reactions of post vaccination and indentify the significant symptoms of after effects.
