COVID-19 Drug Prediction To identify key gene expression pathways altered with infection of the novel coronavirus SARS-Cov-2, we performed the largest comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis to date. We compared the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 with SARS and MERS, as well as Influenza A strains H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1. Phylogenetic analysis confirms that SARS-Cov-2 is closely related to SARS at the level of the viral genome. RNASeq analyses demonstrate that human lung epithelial cell responses to SARS-Cov-2 infection are distinct. Extensive Gene Expression Omnibus literature screening and drug predictive analyses show that SARS-Cov-2 infection response pathways are closely related to those of SARS and Respiratory Syncytial Virus infections. We validated SARS-Cov-2 infection response genes as disease-associated using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates in lung disease patient data. We also analysed COVID-19 patient peripheral blood samples, showing signalling pathway concordance between the primary lung cell and blood cell infection responses.
